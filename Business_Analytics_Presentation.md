**"Business Analytics Project: Transforming Data into Decisions"**
- Presenter: [Your Name]
- Date: [Date]
- Duration: 4 minutes

## Slide 2: Agenda (30 seconds)
1. **Information Usage Definition** - How data is delivered and used
2. **Data Requirements** - The foundation of analytics
3. **Analysis Transformation** - From raw data to insights
4. **Key Success Factors** - What makes analytics projects work

---

## Slide 3: Information Usage Definition (1 minute)

### The Challenge
- Complex analytics results must be delivered in **usable form**
- BA must determine: **Human vs Automated** decision making
- Balance between user control and system intelligence

### Real Example: Sales Dashboard
- **Executive sales team** needs daily dashboard
- **10 different filters**: timeframe, region, price band
- **Drill-down capability**: From region → product line → specific details
- **Immediate response**: Real-time data manipulation

### Three Key Aspects:
1. **Delivery Mechanism**: Email, portals, mobile devices
2. **Format**: Reports, dashboards, raw data
3. **Flexibility**: User manipulation capabilities

## Slide 4: Data Requirements (1 minute)

### The Foundation
- **Data forms the core** of all business analytics solutions
- BA + Data experts collaboration is essential
- Understanding data sources, storage, and management

### Big Data Characteristics
- **Volume**: Large amounts of data
- **Velocity**: Rapid data flow
- **Variety**: Diverse and complex data types

### Key Questions for Data Requirements:
- **Sources**: What data do you need? Where is it?
- **Storage**: How much data? Growth expectations?
- **Management**: Data structure, transformations, security
- **Extraction**: Real-time vs batched? Query performance?

## Slide 5: Analysis Transformation (1 minute)

### The Computational Engine
- **Transforms raw data** into actionable insights
- **Three time frames**: Past, Present, Future
- **Decision-making spectrum**: Descriptive → Predictive

### Analysis Types:
1. **Descriptive**: "What happened?"
2. **Diagnostic**: "Why did it happen?"
3. **Predictive**: "What will happen?"
4. **Prescriptive**: "What should we do?"

### Real-World Example:
- **Retail facial recognition**: Camera scans customer
- **Automated decision**: Which ad to play based on demographics
- **Risk**: Automated systems can amplify errors (stock market example)

## Slide 6: Key Success Factors (30 seconds)

### Critical Elements:
1. **Clear Decision Framework**: Understand what decisions need to be made
2. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on how users will actually use the information
3. **Data Quality**: Ensure reliable, clean, and accessible data
4. **Security & Governance**: Protect sensitive information
5. **Flexibility**: Allow for exploration and what-if scenarios

### The BA's Role:
- **Bridge** between business needs and technical capabilities
- **Educate** stakeholders on analytics possibilities
- **Specify** requirements that enable both human and automated decisions
