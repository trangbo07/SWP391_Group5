# Services Management Implementation

## Overview
This implementation replaces the existing "product" functionality with a "services" management system for medical services. The system displays a list of medical services from the `ListOfMedicalService` database table.

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend Implementation
1. **ServiceServlet.java** (`src/main/java/controller/ServiceServlet.java`)
   - Maps to `/services` endpoint
   - Handles GET requests with "api" action parameter
   - Returns JSON data of services from database
   - Uses existing `ListOfMedicalServiceDAO` for data access

### Frontend Implementation
2. **services.js** (`src/main/webapp/assets/jslogic/services.js`)
   - `ServicesManager` class for handling service data
   - Async service loading from backend API
   - Dynamic table rendering with proper formatting
   - Vietnamese currency formatting for prices
   - Error handling and loading states

3. **services.html** (`src/main/webapp/view/services.html`)
   - Modified from products.html
   - Updated navigation and page title
   - Clean table structure for services display
   - Includes services.js script

## Database Schema
The implementation uses the existing `ListOfMedicalService` table with the following structure:
```sql
- service_id (int) - Primary key
- name (varchar) - Service name
- description (varchar) - Service description  
- price (double) - Service price
```

## API Endpoints

### GET /services?action=api
Returns JSON array of all medical services:
```json
[
  {
    "service_id": 1,
    "name": "General Consultation",
    "description": "Basic medical consultation",
    "price": 100000.0
  }
]
```

## Features Implemented
- ✅ Dynamic loading of services from database
- ✅ Responsive table with loading states
- ✅ Vietnamese currency formatting (VND)
- ✅ Dropdown action menus for each service
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Clean separation between backend API and frontend

## Features for Future Implementation
- [ ] Add new service functionality
- [ ] Edit existing services
- [ ] Delete services
- [ ] Service categorization
- [ ] Search and filtering
- [ ] Pagination for large datasets

## How to Test
1. Start the web application server
2. Navigate to `/view/services.html`
3. The page should load and display medical services from the database
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
5. Verify that the API endpoint `/services?action=api` returns JSON data

## Technical Notes
- Uses Jackson ObjectMapper for JSON serialization (already in project dependencies)
- Follows existing servlet patterns in the project
- Compatible with existing authentication and session management
- Uses Bootstrap for responsive UI components
- Error handling for both backend exceptions and frontend fetch errors

## Dependencies
All required dependencies are already included in the project:
- Jackson for JSON processing
- Lombok for model annotations
- Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver
- Jakarta Servlet API
